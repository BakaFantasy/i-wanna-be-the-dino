# I Wanna Be the Dino

## Platform

Windows 64-bit

## Feature

### Overview

This game was totally powered by C & SDL2 and originated from my midsemester project at *NJUSE*. I combined features of various games, such as Chrome Dino, I Wanna Series, Celeste, &e.

Compared to Chrome Dino, I optimized the control feeling, increased difficulty, added visual effect of death and designed more modes to play.

Enjoy it.
